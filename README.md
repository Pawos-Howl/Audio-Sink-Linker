# Audio Sink Linker
Hi, yeah. I took the general structure of this code from a friend, and made it a touch better I think.

## Use
Run the commands ```pw-link -o``` or ```pw-link -i``` to get the list of audio interfaces (output and input respectively). Put the data up to :L/:R or any form of audio side specification into the file "pipewire-dev-list".
